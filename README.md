=====================
In this project you can get acquainted with my knowledge of **HTML** and **CSS**. I mainly use **Flexbox** technology, but the individual card blocks are made using **Grid**. I also tried to use the **main CSS components** here, such as: **margin and padding, position, box-sizing and of course :before :after**. All code is written using **BEM technology**. The only thing is that I didn't make an adaptive layout for this site, since it was the first project in a long time and I decided not to stay too long on it. I used **Figma** to create this site.

### Summary
* **Basik HTML and CSS**
* **Flexbox**
